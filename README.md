This is a project for the course **SoftwareEngineering** at Leopold-Franzens
University. The goal is to implement a prototype of a game called **TimeGuess.**

In this repository:

- `diagrams` gives an overview of our project with a class diagramm, a component diagramm and a use case diagramm.

- `backend` contains the implementation of the server-side backend

- `raspberry` contains the source code that is running on a Raspberry Pi and connects the TimeFlip
  device with the central server backend

- `time-records` contains tables with time records
###todo:
- `gitlab-ci` not sure about this one yet???
