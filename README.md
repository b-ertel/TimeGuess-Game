This is the top-level README file of our project.

We should add some meaningful content here. :)

In the meantime, just note that the project consists of two
separate parts:

- a central server backend (see folder `backend`)
- a program that runs on a Raspberry Pi and connects the TimeFlip
  device with the central server backend (see folder `raspberry`)
