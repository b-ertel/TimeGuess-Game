Notes on using the REST API
***************************

The following information might be useful if you don't have
a TimeFlip device or Raspberry Pi and want to use the REST API
directly (e.g., with Insomnia or any other tool).

------------------
1. Status Messages
------------------

The backend expects regular POST requests of the following
JSON format at the URL "/api/status":

{
    "identifier": "56:23:89:34:56",
    "calibrationVersion": 1,
    "batteryLevel": 90,
    "rssi": -50
}

Here "identifier" is the MAC address of the TimeFlip device,
"calibrationVersion" is the the current value of the calibration
version characteristic, "batteryLevel" is the current value
of the battery level characteristic and "rssi" is the current
value of the RSSI property.

It then sends back an answer in the following JSON format:

{
    "reportingInterval": 10,
    "calibrationVersion": 1
}

Here "reportingInterval" is the interval until the next status
messages shall be sent and "calibrationVersion" is the new
value for the calibration version characteristic.

The calibration version is zero after a "hard reset" of
the TimeFlip device (i.e., after the battery has been
taken out) and is sent to the backend in order to be able
to detect such an event and delete all saved configurations
for the TimeFlip device since after a "hard reset" the
facet numbers might have changed. When simulating just
send an arbitrary nonzero value for the calibration version
characteristic.

The backend considers a cube "offline" if no status
message has been received for a certain time. In order to
avoid this when simulating you have two possibilities:

- frequently send status messages :)
- set a higher value for the "Expiration Interval"
  in the admin web interface

------------------
2. Facets Messages
------------------

The backend accepts POST requests of the following JSON format
indicating a change of the facets characteristic at the URL
"/api/facets":

{
    "identifier": "56:23:89:34:56",
    "facet": 1
}

Here "identifier" is the MAC address of the TimeFlip device
and "facet" is the facet number.

No response will be sent to such requests.


Note that you need "Basic Authentication" with the following
credentials to send messages:

Username: cube
Password: passwd
