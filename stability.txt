Notes on measures to ensure stability in case of failures
*********************************************************

T1 = low battery level of TimeFlip device

The battery level of TimeFlip devices is constantly
monitored and a warning message is displayed if during
a game the battery level falls below a configurable
threshold.

T2 = limited communication between TimeFlip device and Raspberry Pi

The RSSI property of TimeFlip devices is constantly
monitored and a warning message is displayed if during
a game the RSSI property falls below a configurable
threshold.

In addition to this, the Raspberry Pi constantly checks
if the Bluetooth connection with the TimeFlip device is lost
and will automatically make attempts to reconnect if this
is required.

(Automatic reconnection was successfully tested with the real
hardware using "rfkill block" and "rfkill unblock" on the
Raspberry Pi.)

T3 = unexpected reboot of Raspberry Pi

Due to the stateless nature of our communication protocol
between Raspberry Pi and backend, this will cause no
problems other than possibly a temporary timeout, displayed
as a warning message in the web app, if the reboot takes
longer than a configurable amount of time, and operation
will continue normally after that.

T4 = temporary unavailability of connection between Raspberry Pi and backend

Due to the stateless nature of our communication protocol
between Raspberry Pi and backend, this will cause no
problems other than possibly a temporary timeout, displayed
as a warning message in the web app, if the connection is
unavailable for longer than a configurable amount of time, and
operation will continue normally after that.

(This was successfully tested with the real hardware by
removing the network cable.)

T5 = temporary unavailability of backend

The Raspberry Pi will wait for the backend to be available again
and will continue to work normally once this is the case.

However, note that due to the fact that we use an in-memory database (H2)
rather than a "real" one, it will usually not be the case
that operation continues normally after such an event (e.g., continue
games that were in status played when the backend went down)
because of a data loss.
